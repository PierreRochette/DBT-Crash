- In the "postgres" folder (generated by docker and not included in this repository), creating a `airflow_init.sql` file. 

- If trouble setting up the Postgres container, delete the data folder in postgres folder, than retry building docker. 

- When airflow setted up, check in the logs for that kind of entry: `Simple auth manager | Password for user 'admin': 2NGPyCrm8k4dEK4k`. Keep it carefully, because will be needed to access the airflow interface. 

- Airflow will be available at `localhost:8000`, or wether port specified. 

- Don't mind erros on orchestrator.py, the python file is suited for airflow, which is not executed locally. 

- After doing docker compose up, enter those commands : `docker-compose run dbt`, choose postgres, host is db, port is 5432, user and password and db is which defined in docker compose, 4 for threads 

- If the project is downloaded, check the dbt command in the docker compose file, and change it as needed
